# React Web Component Demo

Creates a web component from a react functional component. 

Also compares vite to esbuild for building the web component. 
Vite HMR doesn't work when loading web components

esbuild is preferred as it works for local development and production bundling as one would expect (serve rebundles on change and changes show up on the server).
